# Image Classifier

This project demonstrates how to upload an image file from a web form, send it to a server for processing, and classify the image using ML5.js image classification with the MobileNet model.

## How It Works

1. The user selects an image file using the provided form.
2. When the form is submitted, the file is uploaded to the server using a POST request.
3. The server processes the image and returns the result along with the image data.
4. The client receives the response and displays the image along with the classification result.
